longDescription: |
  AgentMail is an API-first email provider that gives agents their own inboxes to send, receive, and act upon emails. Think of it like Gmail, but with:
  - Automated, unlimited inbox creation and management
  - Usage-based pricing scaling with emails sent/received
  - No restrictive rate/sending limits
  - Real-time events over webhooks and websockets
  - Simple API key auth, no OAuth headaches
  - Built-in API permissions and agent guardrails
  - Semantic search across every inbox in organization
  - Automatic labeling with user-defined prompts
