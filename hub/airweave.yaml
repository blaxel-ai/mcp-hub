description: AI agent search platform that lets agents search any app with 100+ connectors and unified search layer
longDescription: Airweave is a comprehensive AI agent infrastructure platform that enables intelligent agents to search and interact with any application or data source. It provides over 100 pre-built connectors for popular services like GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, Notion, and more, allowing agents to access and synchronize data from multiple sources through a unified search layer. The platform features white-labeled multi-tenant support with OAuth2-based security, automated sync capabilities, semantic search across all connected data sources, and scalable deployments from Docker Compose to Kubernetes. Airweave transforms fragmented data silos into agent-ready knowledge, making it easier to build smart agents that can retrieve contextual information from across an organization's entire data ecosystem without custom integrations.
